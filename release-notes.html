<b>Enhancements</b>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/24">[issue 24]</a> Select a different html template file while composer is open. Note that <i>any manually entered text will be discarded</i> when you change the template, so do this before you start typing.
  
  In order to do this the new <i>Change Template</i> button can be added via right-click and <i>Customize</i> on the composer toolbar. After adding the button, reopen the Composer window to update it with the appropriate template list (write / reply or forward).
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/60">[issue 60]</a> Fixed some barriers with screenreader navigation in Settings Dialog. All buttons on the settings screen can now be executed without mouse clicks. Also the licensing message will be displayed as a OS notification which will be read out by the widely accepted JAWS reader. It appears that NVDA still cannot read these. Many thanks to my user Rüdiger L. for testing this with me.</li>
  <li>Completed translations for Serbian locale.</li>
  <li>2.11.1: Add change template button to toolbar automatically. I don't think many people have actually seen or tried it even though it was a much requested feature. Keep forgetting that nobody has time to read change logs - a feature that cannot be seen might as well not be there.</li>
  <li>Add translations for the new "change template" button in Composer.</li>
</ul>

<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>

    </li>  
    <li>2.11.1 <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/68">[issue 68]</a> Regression (2.11): After update SmartTemplate⁴ always displays nonlicensed support sites
    </li>  
</ul>
