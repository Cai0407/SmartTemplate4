<b>Enhancements</b>
<ul>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/24">[issue 24]</a> Select a different html template file while composer is open. Note that <i>any manually entered text will be discarded</i> when you change the template, so do this before you start typing.
    
    In order to do this the new <i>Change Template</i> button can be added via right-click and <i>Customize</i> on the composer toolbar. After adding the button, reopen the Composer window to update it with the appropriate template list (write / reply or forward).
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/60">[issue 60]</a> Fixed some barriers with screenreader navigation in Settings Dialog. All buttons on the settings screen can now be executed without mouse clicks. Also the licensing message will be displayed as a OS notification which will be read out by the widely accepted JAWS reader. It appears that NVDA still cannot read these. Many thanks to my user RÃ¼diger L. for testing this with me.</li>
    <li>Completed translations for Serbian locale.</li>
