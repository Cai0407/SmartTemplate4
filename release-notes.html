<b>2.3.1 Maintenance version with important fixes for the new file templates feature.</b>

Release video - showcases the new file templates feature: https://youtu.be/AWdZWB0_ym0

<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li>2.3.1 - Improved handling of non-working Stationery in Thunderbird 68. You can now jump straight into configuring file templates and "support stationery" will be automatically disabled if it cannot be run in the current Tb version.</li>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/8">issue #8</a>] Support File Templates - to replace Stationery from Thunderbird 68 forward. 

I have repeatedly reached out to the author of the excellent Stationery Add-on over the last 8 months, but unfortunately did not get any reply. I also attempted to patch it for Thunderbird68 but it is just too much work. (I estimate 2-3 man weeks)

SmartTemplate⁴ still supports it, but it looks like it will stop working as soon as Thunderbird 68 lands in August / September 2019; therefore we need another solution to be able to use ad-hoc templates in the form of HTML files.

The template management system will be tightly integrated into the familiar SmartTemplate⁴ settings interface, as a separate entry in the Accounts drop-down.
</li>
<li>[v2.3.1] Fixed <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/14">[issue 14]</a>: If Lightning is not installed in Thunderbird 68, currently the new "file templates" function will not load the template, but may open 2 composer windows instead.</li>
<li>[v2.3.1] Fixed <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/15">[issue 15]</a>: file templates only work on an account if the box <i>Apply following template</i> is active.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26689" target="_blank">[Bug 26689]</a> New function to set E-mail priority

 Add a function to set the priority of the composed Email.

Examples:

%header.set(priority,highest)%
%header.set(priority,high)%
%header.set(priority,normal)%
%header.set(priority,low)%
%header.set(priority,lowest)%</li>
</ul>
