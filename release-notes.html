<b>Enhancements</b>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/59">[issue 59]</a> External templates: SmartTemplate&#8308 now supports image tags with relative location.  This will make external templates management more compatible with Stationery and make it easier to preview / trouble shoot our templates in a web browser.

In order to use relative image paths, such as &lt;img src="images/img1.jpg"&gt; these tags must be included in a html template. To use this in an account template, simply include the external html file using the %file()% variable. When SmartTemplate opens the file, it will now remember the file's location and be able to insert images from this position, just like when loading a  stored web page.

After placing the cursor in the template field, expand the dialog via <i>Advanced</i> and open the chapter <i>fixed variables</i>. Then Click on the <code class="inline">%file()%</code> variable and select a file from disk.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/54">[issue 54]</a> Support including external style sheets. Use the new %style()% variable to insert a style block wtih CSS rules. Also, supports relative paths, just like %file()%.</li>
<li>Remember the last path separately for opening templates from the menu directly.</li>
<li>Plain text
</ul>

<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/51">[issue 51]</a> Outgoing SMTP always using DEFAULT account. When changing the <i>from</i> address from the drop down before editing the email, Thunderbird did not internally change the from header, which could cause emails to be sent from the wrong account. This is now fixed.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/54">[issue 54]</a>Fixed: ST4 now removes unwanted empty lines in reply/forward headers in plain-text emails.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/55">[issue 55]</a> Added back some of the support for Postbox, which was broken since v2.1. You can find patched versions of previous releases at the issue.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/58">[issue 58]</a> If firstName is guessed from the address book field <i>DisplayName</i>,  it can lead to last name duplication in case a format like <code class="inline">%from(firstname,lastname)%</code> is used and the first name field in the address card is empty.</li>
</ul>
