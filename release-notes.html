<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/SmartTemplate4/issues/8">issue #8</a>] Support File Templates - to replace Stationery from Thunderbird 68 forward. 

I have repeatedly reached out to the author of the excellent Stationery Add-on over the last 8 months, but unfortunately did not get any reply. I also attempted to patch it for Thunderbird68 but it is just too much work. (I estimate 2-3 man weeks)

SmartTemplate⁴ still supports it, but it looks like it will stop working as soon as Thunderbird 68 lands in August / September 2019; therefore we need another solution to be able to use ad-hoc templates in the form of HTML files.

The template management system will be tightly integrated into the familiar SmartTemplate⁴ settings interface, as a separate entry in the Accounts drop-down.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26689" target="_blank">[Bug 26689]</a> New function to set E-mail priority

 Add a function to set the priority of the composed Email.

Examples:

%header.set(priority,highest)%
%header.set(priority,high)%
%header.set(priority,normal)%
%header.set(priority,low)%
%header.set(priority,lowest)%</li>
</ul>
<b>Bug Fixes</b>
