  <li>
    I have started to rewrite all mail Add-ons for compatibility with Thunderbird 78. I have hired a developer and am currently thinking of ways to fund raise the development effort - probably several man weeks of rewriting. please do not manually update to Thunderbird78 yet. An automatic update will not happen until September 2020.
    
    If you are interested in using a version of SmartTemplate&#8308 that works with Thunderbird 78, consider         
    <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/smarttemplate4?referrer=st-version-page">buying a license</a>
    to support the project.

    In other news we have just successfully migrated all Add-on support sites away from the free host on <span class="emphasis">mozdev.org, which is now closed</span>. To keep having support sites and ongoing development, please 
    <a href="http://sites.fastspring.com/quickfolders/product/smarttemplate4?referrer=st-version-page">buy a license</a>
    (the migration has cost around $650, so there are some expense I hope to recover from the community of users).
