<h2 class="page-header">SmartTemplate<sup>4</sup> Pro :: Premium Features</h2>

<article>
	<p class="attention">
	 <em>ATTENTION:</em> This information is under Review - Feature currently Work In Progress, but planned for release 
	 <a href="version.html#1.5">1.5</a>.<br>
	</p>
</article>

<p>
  Premium features are power functions which are an incentive for users 
  to regularly support the SmartTemplate<sup>4</sup> project through a yearly contribution, 
	called SmartTemplate‚Å¥ Pro license. 
	My aim is that instead of very few people trying to carry the project with sometimes large donations to 
	try involving more supporters. It is a lot of work to keep the project going and up to date with all the 
	latest code changes which happen every 6 weeks on the Mozilla code base. Staying in sync with the 
	three applications (Thunderbird, Postbox and SeaMonkey) and to support multiple platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) 
	and languages and writing support emails and fixing bugs is actually a lot of work. 
	I would rather actually spend more time on this as opposed to maybe 6 to 12 hours / week, but for this it 
	needs to be financially viable.

<h3 class="helpchapter">What Premium Features exist?</h3>
<p>Here is a list of Premium features that are unrestricted to licensed users.</p> 
<p>For non-licensed users, the premium features can be restricted and, when used, will show a notification bar
  in order to promote buying a license. I feel this is the best way as it gives you a chance to try them out and 
  get an idea on what other great future functionality will be funded by supporters:<p>

<h3 class="helpchapter">String Manipulation</h3>
<article>
	<ul>
		<li><code>%deleteText("text")%</code> = Remove some text from the Quote Header, such as deleteText("via Paypal")- "John via Paypal wrote" =&gt; "John wrote"</li>
		<li><code>%replaceText("find","replace")%</code> = Replace some text with something else (similar to deleteText).</li>
		<li><code>%matchTextFromBody("Regular Expression",MatchGroup)%</code> = 
		    Finds a pattern in quoted Email and insert at function location.<br>
				E.g. <code class="inline">%matchTextFromBody("Delivery from ([-'a-zA-Z\u00C0-\u024F]*\s[-'a-zA-Z\u00C0-\u024F]*)",1)%</code> 
				will retrieve 'John Doe' from the line 'Delivery from John Doe' - (included unicode characters for diacritics)</li>
		<li><code>%matchTextFromSubject("Regular Expression",MatchGroup)%</code> = 
		    Finds a pattern in subject and insert at function location.<br>
				E.g. <code class="inline">%matchTextFromSubject("\b[a-zA-Z0-9._+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}\b",0)%</code> 
				will retrieve an Email address from the Subject line</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Note: the new <code class="inline">%matchTextFromBody%</code> and <code class="inline">%matchTextFromSubject%</code> functions 
	   use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank">regular expressions</a> - these are powerful keys for finding text patterns.
		 The first parameter must be the regular expression within double quotes. The second parameter is a number which denotes the "match group". 
		 Match groups are usually designated with round parentheses (). Use 0 to match the complete expression, 1 for the first group etc.

<!-- ##### Header Functions #### -->
<a name="dateManipulation"> </a>
<h3 class="helpchapter">Advanced Date Functions</h3>
<article>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			  <code class="deferable">%dateformat%</code> function for inserting / updating current time. 
				<a name="26588" href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26588" target="_blank">[Bug 26588]</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				The format variables are taken from the regular formats such as %Y% for 4-digit
				Years, with the % symbols stripped. Use as follows: <br>
				%dateformat(<i>formatString</i>)%
			</p>
			<p>
				Supported Formats:
				Y, y, n, m, e, d, k, H, l, I, M, S, tz_name, B, b, A, a, p1, p2, p
			</p>
			<p>
				Examples:<br>
				<code class="inline">%dateformat(A, e/n/Y, H:M)%</code> creates: Wednesday, 23/02/2018, 14:23
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>%X:=calculated()%</code> Switch for modifying date & time displayed. <a href="https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26307" target="_blank">[Bug 26307]</a>
			<p>
			<code>%X:=calculated(d,h:mm)%</code> where <i>d</i> = is the number of days to add. <i>h</i> = number of hours and <i>mm</i> number of minutes.
			Note this needs to be reset using
			<code>%X:=calculated(0)%</code> to reset it for the rest of the Email.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

<!-- ##### Header Functions #### -->
<a name="headerManipulation"> </a>
<h3 class="helpchapter">Mail Header Manipulation</h3>
<article>
	<ul>
		<li><code>%header.set(<i>hdr</i>,"text")%</code> = Set the header <i>hdr</i> (eg. to, from, subject) with the text.</li>
		<li><code>%header.set(subject,"text")%</code> = Replace complete subject with the text</li>
		<li><code>%header.prefix(subject,"text")%</code> = Prefix subject with the text</li>
		<li><code>%header.append(subject,"text")%</code> = Append text to subject</li>
		<li><code>%header.delete(subject,"text")%</code> = Delete text from subject</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The following functions are using Regular Expressions (search patterns) - these are for 
		advanced users only but can give you great rewards in automating emails. More info below.
	</p>
	<ul>
    <li><code>%header.set.matchFromSubject(<i>hdr,regex,group</i>)%</code> = Set the header if a matching regular expression is found in subject line.</li>
    <li><code>%header.append.matchFromSubject(<i>hdr,regex,group</i>)%</code> = Append text to header / recipient if a matching regular expression is found in subject line.</li>
    <li><code>%header.prefix.matchFromSubject(<i>hdr,regex,group</i>)%</code> = Prefix text to header if a matching regular expression is found in subject line.</li>
    <li><code>%header.set.matchFromBody(<i>hdr,regex,group</i>)%</code> = Set the header if a matching regular expression is found in quoted email.</li>
    <li><code>%header.append.matchFromBody(<i>hdr,regex,group</i>)%</code> = Append text to header / recipient if a matching regular expression is found in quoted email.</li>
    <li><code>%header.prefix.matchFromBody(<i>hdr,regex,group</i>)%</code> = Prefix text to header if a matching regular expression is found in quoted email.</li>
	</ul>
<p>
	The <i>hdr</i> parameter represents a mail header that has textual content, such as (to, from, subject). 
	This cannot be used for headers containing dates such as the sent time.
</p>
<p>
	The <i>regex</i> parameter is a search pattern in the form of a regular expression; 
	for more documentation, please check the site
	<a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/.">Regular-expressions.info</a>.
	There is also a useful <a href="https://regex101.com/">regular expressions tester</a> 
	for trying out your search patterns. For best results, make sure to switch the "Flavor" 
	field to <i>ECMAScript (JavaScript)</i>.
</p>
<p>
	The <i>group</i> parameter is the number of the matched expression, for an explanation 
  <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/refcapture.html">see here.</a> 
	Usually setting this to 1 will do what is needed most of the time 
	(replaces first found expression with first match).
</p>
<p>	
<p> Additionally, you can now use the matchFromSubject and matchFromBody functions in the following way:</p>
<code>%header.set.matchFromBody(<i>hdr,regex</i>,"replacement text")%</code></p>
<p>
  The main difference is that match group is a number - which will insert / set / append 
  The matched text found during the search, whereas replacement text is a text that is used 
	instead if the search pattern is found. For usage simply add the double quotation marks around the 3rd parameter.

	<ul>
		<li><code class="inline">%header.set(to,"abc@de.com")%</code> = Replace recipient with email address</li>
		<li><code class="inline">%header.append(to,"abc@de.com")%</code> = Add email to recipient list</li>
		<li><code class="inline">%header.set.matchFromSubject(to,"Donation from .* \((\b[a-zA-Z0-9._+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4}\b)\)",1)%</code><br>
		Looks for a pattern "Donation from <i>Name</i> (<i>email</i>)" and extracts email address to set the recipient (to) header.<br>
		.* is a group of any arbitrary character(s) in order to omit the Name portion of the email address<br>
		\(  and \)  match the parentheses,<br>
		\b means the result of the match group (...) starts at the beginning of the email address and ends before the closing parenthesis.<br>
		[a-zA-Z0-9._+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,4} is a standard email matching expression. <br>
		1 - means the result from the first <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/brackets.html" target="_blank">match group</a> (...) is used for setting the header.

<h3 class="helpchapter">Files and Images</h3>
<article>
	<ul>
    <li>
		  <code>%file(<i>filePath</i>,<i>encoding</i>)%</code> = Include HTML or plain text file. When omitting the <i>encoding</i> 
			parameter, SmartTemplate<sup>4</sup> will assume <tt>UTF-8</tt>. If the file contains more SmartTemplate<sup>4</sup> 
			variables such as <code class="inline">%from%</code>, these will be resolved.
		</li>
    <li>
		  <code>%file(<i>imagePath</i>,<i>altText</i>)%</code> = Inserts an image file (png,jpg,gif,bmp,svg). 
			The optional altText is displayed if the image can't be found.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For the correct <i>file path</i> syntax, click the 
		<code>%file%</code> label in the Variables tab in the SmartTemplate<sup>4</sup> settings window. 
		This will open a standard file prompt and then insert the correct code into the template.

<h3 class="helpchapter">Deferred Variables - Fields in New Emails</h3>
<article>
  <p>This was a premium feature, but will be added as a feature for Standard License users from version 2.1.1 onwards. It only works in <b>HTML emails</b> - plain text emails are <i>not supported</i> for technical reasons.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><div class="new">NEW</div>
			<p>When writing new mails, headers such as to, from are not available - therefore these 
				 functions had to be written from scratch.

			<p>Note, to  insert the real recipient in a <i>forwarded</i> email, you can now use the <tt>fwd</tt> argument:
				 e.g. <code class="deferable">%to(firstname,fwd)%</code> </p>
			<p>The variables are shown as colored placeholder blocks and can be updated with a simple mouse-click: <br>
				<img class="screenshot" src="/img/deferred-vars-example.png" alt="deferred variables"><br>
				This will pull in the correct information when available and can be clicked multiple times.

<h3 class="helpchapter">Other Benefits of having a Yearly License</h3>
	<p>
		You know that you support the project and that the development and support will be continue.
		There is a huge amount of work involved not just programming and keeping SmartTemplate<sup>4</sup> up to date 
		but also supporting users, coming up with better ways of doing things, fixing bugs, and keeping 
		SmartTemplate<sup>4</sup> usable across various platforms and host programs (at the moment I support Thunderbird, 
		SeaMonkey and Postbox). I am constantly helping people with using SmartTemplate<sup>4</sup> and their mail program 
		and how to get the most out of email on the desktop.
	</p>
	<p>
		All notification messages that indicate premium features are omitted.
	</p>
	<p>
		The donation screen (which is normally shown after every Update) is hidden.
	</p>
<h3 class="helpchapter">Alternative Monetisation Models</h3>
	<p>
		There are quite a few software developers (and also some users) who believe
		that software should generally financed by advertisement or even by selling 
		information about their users. 
		I am firmly opposed to this way of making money as it impacts 
		both productivity and privacy rights; also in the world of Email I would 
		find this way of generating value deeply problematic - even if it was 
		strictly opt-in. There is a lot of personal information in our daily mail 
		and a lot of knowledge that is being stored and retrieved with this powerful 
		tool. 
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the reasons for a personal Email Client on the desktop 
		is the fact that we can store our data on our personal hardware and use it 
		any way we like. On the other hand, if we use a web mail client (like gmail) 
		we can never be sure whether the information is used otherwise and whether 
		we get targeted with distracting information (be it by injecting advertisements or via 
		targeted advertisement emails) - it is one of the goals of any mail desktop client 
		to eliminiate these distractions as much as possible, and focus on one thing only:
		managing communication.
	</p>
	<p>
		SmartTemplate<sup>4</sup> is an especially powerful set of tools to harness this 
		information and it will evolve and keep saving time and make your experience 
		of mail more meaningful and intuitive.
