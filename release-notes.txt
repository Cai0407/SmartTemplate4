Change List version 2.1 Improvements

    [Bug 26536] Support using SmartTemplate⁴ variables in Thunderbird Templates (Tb 60).
    [Bug 26626] Added a variable to set a specific time zone (e.g. GMT) for date/time variables. Use the new %X:=timezone(timezone)% switch to force displaying the time with a fixed time zone. For example: %X:=timezone(EST)% for inserting Eastern Standard Time in date functions such as %dateshort% or %dateformat()%
    [Bug 26634] header.*.matchFrom* functions: append/prepend arbitrary text to field based on match. You can now use the matchFromSubject and matchFromBody functions in the following way: %header.set.matchFromBody(header,search pattern,"replacement text")% this is different from the already supported usage %header.set.matchFromBody(header,search pattern,match group)% The main difference is that match group is a number - which will insert / set / append the matched text found during the search, whereas replacement text is a text that is used instead if the search pattern is found. For usage simply add the double quotation marks around the 3rd parameter.
    Added button for extending your SmartTemplate⁴ Pro License. This will now show up on the SmartTemplate⁴ Pro Tab 30 days before the current license expires. The web shop will give you an additional year based on the current expiry date for a smaller price (typically 20 %) than a new license. If the license is already expired, then the current date is used to calculate new expiry date, giving you also a full year.
    SmartTemplate⁴ from now on will remember the last selected folder using the file picker when saving / loading templates.

Bug Fixes

    [Bug 26626] Edit As New duplicated email content unless Stationery is installed.
    [Bug 26627] Signature was always removed when creating message from templates. With this fix, when creating a mail from a thunderbird template the signature will be treated according tothe rules set up in account settings composition section. To omit the signature, use %sig(none)%within the template. To determine a specific position other than specified in account settings, use %sig(html)%
    Fixed: %attach()% command previously had a filter to only append HTML files.
    [Bug 26628] Fixed: %dateshort% and %datelocal% left out time portion.
    [Bug 26632] Using %dateformat% in reply / forward: deferred fields were not automatically tidied up.
    [Bug 26635] Cursor not placed in "To:" Row when writing/forwarding email. Fix: SmartTemplate⁴ will now check when writing new emails if the "To:" address is already set. If not, the cursor will be placed into the address widget and %cursor% ignored.
    [Bug 26636] Stationery broken with %sig(text)%. When using a Stationery template with the "Use instead of default quote header" option switched off, some of the template text may be accidentally deleted from the Email.
